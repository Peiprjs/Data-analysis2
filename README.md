# Minor AI Microbiome Data analysis project

## Overview

This project analyses and predicts microbiome data on a selected subset from the LucKi cohort. The analysis focuses on bacterial abundance patterns across different age groups and samples, using MetaPhlAn 4.1.1 taxonomic profiles.

### Key Features

- **Data Integration**: Merges abundance tables with sample metadata
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Processing data via CLR
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualizes sample distributions and bacterial abundance patterns
- **Machine Learning**: Implements Random Forest regression models for predictive analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: Performs PCA and feature selection on taxonomic data
- **Branches expansion**: Experimenting with alternative methods like Neural Networks to improve the features selection

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MAI-David/Data-analysis.git
cd Data-analysis
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
cd notebooks
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- click
- colorama
- supertree
- xgboost
- lightgbm
- lime
- shap

In order to run branch with Neural Networks feature selection, these optional dependencies are required:
- tensorflow

## Usage

The main analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook data-pipeline.ipynb
```

The notebook is organized into the following sections:
1. **Housekeeping**: Library imports, settings, and function definitions
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data import, merging, encoding, and cleaning
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations and statistical summaries
4. **Model Training**: Random Forest regressor development with genus-level features

Cross-validation and Neural Networks functions are kept in a separate python file:

```bash
cd notebooks
nano functions.py
```

## Data

The analysis uses two main data sources located in `data/raw/`:

- **MAI3004_lucki_mpa411.csv**: MetaPhlAn 4.1.1 abundance table (6903 × 932)
  - Contains taxonomic profiles with relative abundances for each sample
  - Each row represents a taxonomic clade
  - Columns are prefixed with `mpa411_` for sample identifiers
  - **Note**: Data was manually converted from TSV to CSV format for proper Pandas loading

- **MAI3004_lucki_metadata_safe.csv**: Sample metadata (930 × 6)
  - Contains demographic and sample information
  - Includes family ID, sex, age group, and collection details

### Dataset Characteristics

The LucKi cohort subdataset consists of **930 stool samples** collected from multiple individuals across different families. Key characteristics include:

- **High-dimensional data**: Approximately 6,900 microbiome features
- **Sparse dataset**: Each sample contains on average ~1200 geni and ~300 taxa  
- **Consistent sequencing depth**: Total microbial abundance per sample is relatively stable
- **Rare taxa dominance**: Most taxa occur in only a small fraction of samples
- **Prevalent taxa subset**: A small subset of taxa is highly prevalent across the cohort
- **Log-normal distribution**: Non-zero abundances follow an approximately log-normal shape (typical for microbiome sequencing data)

## Analysis Workflow

The data pipeline follows these main steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Import raw abundance data and metadata (manually converted from TSV to CSV format)
2. **Data Merging**: Combine abundance profiles with sample metadata
3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Label encoding for categorical variables (family_id, sex, age_group)
   - Handle missing values
   - Detect and analyze outliers using IQR method
   - Check normality assumptions with Shapiro-Wilk tests
4. **Train-Test Split**: Separate data before further processing
5. **Normalization**: Apply log transformation to abundance data
6. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze sample distributions and shapes
   - Examine bacterial abundance patterns and prevalence
   - Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
   - **Key Finding**: PCA projection shows a gradual age-related gradient, indicating age-related variation in microbiome composition represents a limited fraction of total variance
7. **Feature Selection**: Filter features at the genus level for model training
8. **Model Training**: 
   - Train Random Forest regressor models
   - Base model evaluation with train/test split
   - Hyperparameter tuning to find optimal model configuration
