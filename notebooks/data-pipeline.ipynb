    "### Summary of EDA\n",
    "The dataset consists of 930 stool samples derived from multiple individuals across different families and contains approximately 6,900 microbiome features, making it a high-dimensional and highly sparse dataset. Each sample contains on average around 300 detected taxa, while the total microbial abundance per sample is relatively stable, indicating that sequencing depth is consistent across samples.\n",
    "Most taxa are rare and occur in only a small fraction of samples, whereas a small subset of taxa is highly prevalent across the cohort. The distribution of non-zero abundances follows an approximately log-normal shape, which is typical for microbiome sequencing data (e.g., Lutz et al., 2022).\n",
    "A PCA projection based on the most prevalent taxa does not reveal sharply separated clusters but shows a gradual age-related gradient, suggesting that age-related variation in microbiome composition is present but represents only a limited fraction of the total variance in the data."
